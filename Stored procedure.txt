--1. Stored Procedure:
--A Stored Procedure is a batch of SQL code that you save and can run over and over again.
--It’s like a function in programming.

Create Procedure GetEmpData as
Select * from employees where salary > 50000
Execute GetEmpData

alter Procedure procedurename

create, Alter & drop (DDL statements can be applied)



---2. View (The "Virtual Window"):
--Output of a query stored in virtual table but it doesn't store the data , its just shows the data.
-- data can only be viewed

Create view PublicEmployee as
select name, Dept from employees (--Here we left salary col. as we wil show what we want to show)
select * from PublicEmployees

--(DDL statements can be applied)


--3. Index
-- if we apply index on salary col., then at the back-end order by is automatically applied on salary col.

create index indexname on table(col. name)

Create Index Idx_employee_email
on employees(email)

-- if primary key constraint is applied on a table, then cluster index will applied by default
-- per table ek hi baar cluster index apply hoga


--4. Trigger:
--Whenever a user is following a negative path or whenever a particular event occurs, We can show an error message using trigger
--eg. "If anyone changes a Salary, automatically write a record to the AuditLog table saying who did it."

Create trigger AuditSalaryChange on employees
After Update 
as Begin
	insert into Auditlog (messae) values ('salary was changed')
	end
